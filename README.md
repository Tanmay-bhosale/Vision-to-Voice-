# Vision-to-Voice-
Realtime object detection using yolov8 model and Audio feedback in python
This project is a Python-based implementation of YOLOv8 for object detection with integrated voice feedback. It supports multiple input sources including webcam, IP cameras, video files, and images. The application is optimized for low-end devices using the YOLOv8 Nano model.

# Features

Real-Time Object Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 Nano for fast and efficient detection.

Voice Feedback: Announces detected objects using text-to-speech.

Supports Multiple Input Sources: Webcam, IP cameras, video files, and images.

Frame Skipping: Optimized processing by skipping frames for better performance on low-end devices.

Bounding Boxes and Labels: Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

# Requirements

Hardware

Low-end devices (e.g., Intel i3 11th Gen or equivalent).

Software

Python 3.8+

Required Python libraries:

ultralytics (for YOLOv8)

opencv-python
